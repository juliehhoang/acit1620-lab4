            <h2>CSS Transitions</h2>
            <p>Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS,
                without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true!</p>

            <p>You now have the potential to atler the appearence and behaviour of an element whenever
                a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.</p>

            <p>For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.
                The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the <b>:hover</b>, <b>:focus</b>, <b>:active</b>, 
                and <b>:target</b> pseudo-classes.</p>

            <p>There are four transition related properties in total, including <b>transition-property</b>, <b>transition-duration</b>,
                 <b>transition-timing-function</b>, and <b>transition-delay</b>. Not all of these are required to build a transition, 
                 with the first three are the most popular.</p>

            <h2>CSS Variables</h2>
                <p> <b>The var()</b> function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.</p>

                <p>A good way to use CSS variables is when it comes to the colors of your design.
                    Instead of copy and paste the same colors over and over again, you can place them in variables.</p>
                
                <p>CSS variables have access to the DOM, which means that you can create variables with local or global scope,
                    change the variables with JavaScript, and change the variables based on media queries.</p>

                <p>Global variables can be accessed/used through the entire document, 
                    while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is declared.</p>
